    description='In today's digital landscape, safeguarding sensitive information is paramount. This project endeavors to bolster cybersecurity measures by employing advanced machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to predict the strength of passwords. By assessing the complexity and uniqueness of passwords, the system categorizes them into strong, weak, or average categories, enabling organizations and individuals to proactively enhance their digital defenses. Through rigorous analysis of password characteristics and comprehensive model training, this project aims to provide accurate and reliable assessments, thereby mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.',
